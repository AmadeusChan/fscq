Here are some ways to profile the CPU usage of Haskell code; in all cases,
it's probably worth setting reallySync=False in hslib/Disk.hs.

1) GHC's built-in profiling.

  Add the "-prof -fprof-auto -rtsopts" GHC arguments in Makefile.
  Run "./fuse .. +RTS -p".
  Run some workload, then unmount the file system.
  Look at the profile in ./fuse.prof.

2) Eventlog.

  Install ghc-events:
    % apt-get install libghc-ghc-events-dev
  Add the "-eventlog" GHC argument in Makefile.
  Uncomment the Profile.progseq line in Extraction.v.
  Edit hslib/Profile.hs to specify which files to profile.
    Profiling all files is costly enough to strongly skew the results.
  Run "./fuse .. +RTS -l-agu".
  Run some workload, then unmount the file system.
  Analyze the eventlog:
    % ghc-events show fuse.eventlog | ./analyze-events.py | sort -n
