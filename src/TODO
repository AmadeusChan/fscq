Replace block addrs with fixed-range Z's.

Replace block values with 512-byte units.

Work out an example of non-determinism in the API (e.g., make
  write_two_blocks at the end of HoareLogicN.v non-deterministic).

Work out an example of higher-level abstraction (e.g., HoareLogicRefine.v).

Work out an example of ephemeral state (e.g., a single-block buffer cache);
  probably needs higher-level abstraction.  Adam suggests passing ephemeral
  state as an argument to each function, and also passing it to the rep
  invariant (e.g., Log.rep), which would then be able to capture invariants
  about both on-disk and in-memory state.

Work out an example that needs separation logic (e.g., split the two
  block writes from write_two_blocks into separate programs, and then
  combine their Hoare triples).

Implement separation logic.

Figure out if we need higher-order Hoare logic.
