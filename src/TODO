- double-indirect blocks
- byte-level read/write
- factor out on-disk list code from MemLog
- bigger log (more than one descriptor block)
- deleting a file should free its data blocks
- prove end-to-end theorem about mkfs
- non-journaled data writes (file fsync)
- asynchronous metadata updates (directory fsync)

- extraction without Haskell
- integrate into MirageOS unikernel by extracting to OCaml

- combine Verdi's Paxos with FSCQ for stable storage, prove end-to-end theorem
  under both network and node failures (how to combine different spec styles??)
- add security to fscq specs (something better than ACLs; maybe capsicum?)
- provably secure sandbox on top of fscq
