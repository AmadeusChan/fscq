FUNCTIONALITY

- maybe doubly-indirect blocks?
- direct data writes

PROOFS/SPECS

- memlog proofs
- directory proofs
- create/delete files (DirAlloc.v)
- end-to-end theorems in FS

EXPERIMENTS

- performance

NOT GOING TO HAPPEN / NICE TO HAVE

- byte-level read/write in Coq
- deleting a file does not free its disk blocks
- mkfs should zero out the first inode
