Replace block addrs with fixed-range Z's.

Replace block values with 512-byte units.

Have programs return values (see some ideas on the "returnvalues" branch).

What should we do about non-determinism in the high-level (source) language?
  We want non-determinism: e.g., return any FD, any mmap addr, any block, any inode.
  But then forward simulation doesn't work because only one choice is possible in
  the target (deterministic) language.  Potential soln: backward simulation directly,
  without going through fsim.  But how difficult is this?
