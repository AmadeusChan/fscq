Replace block addrs with fixed-range Z's.

Replace block values with 512-byte units.

Work out an example of non-determinism in the API (e.g., make
  write_two_blocks at the end of HoareLogicN.v non-deterministic).

Work out an example of higher-level abstraction (e.g., HoareLogicRefine.v).

Work out an example of ephemeral state (e.g., a single-block buffer cache);
  probably needs higher-level abstraction.

Work out an example that needs separation logic (e.g., split the two
  block writes from write_two_blocks into separate programs, and then
  combine their Hoare triples).

Implement separation logic.

Figure out if we need higher-order Hoare logic.
