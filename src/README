To build fscq, use a version of Coq more recent than 8.4 (it has at
least one bug that's tickled by our code).  For now, this seems to mean
building Coq from source:

  git clone https://github.com/coq/coq.git

As one reference point, commit d9736dae seems to produce a working
version of Coq that builds fscq.

To develop Coq code using CoqIDE, check out coqide.sh, which invokes
coqide with the appropriate arguments for spawning many parallel coqtop
processes and setting the right logical-to-physical path mappings.

To build Haskell-extracted code, install a few extra packages:

  sudo apt-get install libghc-cereal-dev
