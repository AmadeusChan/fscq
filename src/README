To build fscq, use a version of Coq more recent than 8.4 (it has at
least one bug that's tickled by our code).  For now, this seems to mean
building Coq from source:

  git clone https://github.com/coq/coq.git

As one reference point, commit 437b91a3 seems to produce a working
version of Coq that builds fscq.
