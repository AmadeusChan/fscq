How to run the benchmarks:

  Make a copy of the fscq repo, without doc or wiki, and make a
  fresh git commit, placing the resulting repo in /tmp/fscq-clean.

  ./run-bench.sh app-bench './app-bench.sh /tmp/fscq-clean /tmp/ft'
  ./run-bench.sh mailbench './mailbench.sh ~/proj/sv6 /tmp/ft'

Install fusexmp from fuse-2.9.3/example.
